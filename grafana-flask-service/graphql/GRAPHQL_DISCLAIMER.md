# GRAPHQL_DICLAIMER

> **DISCLAIMER**: For multitenancy feature enhancement implemented by CapGemini from September 1st to November 6th, 2021, Poly Service Engineering architect advised to moved all GraphQL files into a single folder `graphql/gql` as part of tidying up the project into a clean folder structure. <br>
> The GraphQL API use had been deprecated because it lacked the possibility to retrieve the asset type. It is not used in the November 6th, 2021 multitenancy enhancement. Hence the code hasnâ€™t been tested. However it was decided to keep all the source just in case the Flask data retrieval service needed to extend functionnaly using GraphQL in the future.
